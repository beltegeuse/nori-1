					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						Nori 2 is a minimalistic ray tracer written in C++. It runs
						on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS and provides a foundation for
						the homework assignments in the course
						<a href="https://www.graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/imsynth15/home.php">Image Synthesis</a> taught at ETH Zürich.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Nori provides much support code to simplify your development 
						work as much as possible, the code that you will initially receive
						from us does very little: it loads a scene and saves a rendered image
						as an <span rel="tooltip" title="A popular high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEXR">OpenEXR</a></span> image&mdash;but
						the actual rendering code is missing, hence the output image just
						consists of black pixels.

						Your task will be to extend this system to a full-fledged physically-based 
						renderer as part of programming assignments and your final project.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-6" id="general">
					<h2>Core features</h2>
					The Nori base code provides many features that would be tedious
					to implement from scratch. The following are included:
					<ul>
						<li>A simple GUI to watch images as they render</li>
						<li>An XML-based scene file loader</li>
						<li>Basic point/vector/normal/ray/bounding box classes</li>
						<li>A pseudorandom number generator (<a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/">PCG32</a>)</li>
						<li>Support for saving output as <a href="http://www.openexr.com/">OpenEXR files</a></li>
						<li>A loader for Wavefront OBJ files</li>
						<li>An optimized <a href="Fast and Parallel Construction of SAH-based Bounding Volume Hierarchies">bounding volume hierarchy builder</a></li>
						<li>Ray-triangle intersection</li>
						<li>Code for multi-threaded rendering</li>
						<li>Image reconstruction filters</li>
						<li>Statistical χ<sup>2</sup>- and t-tests to verify sampling code</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Guidelines</h2>
					<h3>Permissible sources of information</h3>
					<p>
						Feel free to consult additional references
						when completing projects, but remember cite them in your writeup.
					</p>
					<p>
						When asked to implement feature \(X\), we request that you don't 
						go and read the source code of the implementation of \(X\) in some other renderer,
						because you will likely not learn much in the process. The PBRT book
						is <span rel="tooltip" title="Technically, this book contains the implementation of a renderer, but that's ok in this case.">excluded</span> from this rule.
						If in doubt, get in touch with the course staff.
					</p>
					<h3>References</h3>
					<p>
						You may find the following general references useful:
						<ul>

							<li>"<em>Advanced Global Illumination</em>" by Philip Dutr&eacute;, Philippe Bekaert, and Kavita Bala. AK Peters, 2nd edition, August 2006.</li>

					<h3>What to submit?</h3>
					<p>
						We will generally inspect but not manually test your submitted code,
						so it's your job to convince us that it does what it's supposed to do.
						
						In addition to the specific requirements of each project, you should
						therefore also turn in a writeup (as a PDF file)
						with the following information:
					</p>
					<h5>Metadata</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Your name and the project title &mdash; 
						e.g. "Project 1: Monte Carlo sampling and statistical hypothesis tests"</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Summary</h5>
						Summarize the most noteworthy aspects of the rest of
						your overview. Anything you mention here should be
						described in more detail later in the document. You might
						include:
					<ul>
						<li>Which parts of the project were the most challenging</li>
						<li>Interesting design decisions that you made.</li>
						<li>Major issues that you ran into while designing, implementing, or testing your submission</li>
						<li>Known problems with your implementation, such as missing functionality or bugs.</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Design and Implementation</h5>
					Discuss how you created a program that satisfies the project specification. This includes topics such as:
					<ul>
						<li>How you decomposed the program into classes, and what the responsibility of each class is.</li>
						<li>What algorithms and data structures are employed in your program. We
						encourage you to include high-level pseudocode of any
						complex algorithms that you use. We also encourage
						discussion of any boundary conditions or formulas
						involved, as well as citations for sources of your
						algorithms.</li>
						<li>Tradeoffs you made between simplicity of code and
						efficiency of execution.</li>
						<li>How did you verify the correctness of your implementation?</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Comments</h5>
					We would appreciate any comments or criticism to improve the
					projects in future years. This section of the overview document will not be graded.
					Examples of information that is useful to us includes:
					<ul>
						<li>How much time did you spend on the assignment? How was it divided between designing, coding, and testing?</li>
						<li>What advice should we have given you before you started?</li>
						<li>What was hard or surprising about the assignment?</li>
						<li>What did you like or dislike? What else would you change?</li>
					</ul>
