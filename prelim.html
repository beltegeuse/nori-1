<h3>The <tt>git</tt> revision control system</h3>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>
	The base code of Nori is provided as a <tt>git</tt> repository. <tt>git</tt>
	is the most widespread distributed version control system in use today&mdash;it is a good
	idea to familiarize yourself with this system if you've never used it before.
</p>
<p>
	Traditionally, a <em>version control system</em> (VCS) allows a team of
	people to collaboratively edit a repository of files. Multiple people might
	happen to work on the same file, and the job of the VCS is to track the
	(potentially conflicting) modifications and merge them into an unambiguous
	repository state that is usable to the rest of the team. These systems
	(e.g. CVS, SVN) store the authoritative repository state in a central
	repository server. Any changes must be <em>committed</em> to this server so
	that other team members can access them.
</p>
<p>
	A <em>distributed version control system</em> (DVCS) is conceptually
	similar: multiple people can collaborate, and there is usually a central
	repository server. The main difference is that there is nothing special
	about this server: anyone with sufficient permissions can copy the entire
	repository state including history data using an operation referred to as
	<em>cloning</em>. From that point on, the local copy acts as a full-fledged
	repository server that works without a network connection to the central
	server. Users can inspect the history of files and even commit new changes,
	which are stored in the local copy. To allow another user to see these
	changes, they can either be <em>pushed</em> to that user's DVCS server, or
		they can be pushed to a central server and then <em>pulled</em> by the
		recipient. There are many providers (such as <a
	 href="http://www.github.com">github</a> or <a
  href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>) which offer free repository
  hosting for open source projects. Because there is nothing special about the
  central server, it's easy to switch providers, and anyone can start their own
  version of an existing repository (this is referred to as <em>forking</em>).

<h3>Why <tt>git</tt>?</h3>
You may wonder why we use <tt>git</tt> in this course given that students are
expected to work on their own. There are multiple good reasons to use it even
for a single-user workflow:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <tt>git diff</tt> feature lets you see what changes you made since the
		last commit and commit messages provide additional context. This
		information is extremely useful when debugging programs that don't work
		as expected.
		This assumes that you will commit every logical change as a commit with
		a descriptive commit message (e.g. "Added a new light source type;
		implementation of interface to come next").
	</li>
	<li>
		The <tt>git branch</tt> feature makes it easy to try out some large
		modifications to your code and switch back and forth. It's easy to undo
		these changes and start from scratch if things don't work out. In
		general, it's good practice to start a new <em>feature branch</em> for
		every major feature (e.g. area light support or multiple importance
		sampling). Once the feature is fully realized and bug-free, it can be
		merged into the main branch. You'll have to implement multiple features
		for the final project, and it's a good idea to to temporarily separate
		them from each other in this way.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may stumble across a bug in your code and wonder when it was introduced.
		The <tt>git bisect</tt> feature lets you quickly find the offending commit.
	</li>
	<li>
		We will likely commit changes to the base code as the semester
		progresses. You can simply <tt>merge</tt> our new revisions into your
		repository to benefit from these improvements.
	</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Cloning using the command line</h3>
	<p>
		The source code of Nori is available on <a
		href="https://github.com/wjakob/nori2">github</a>.
		To check out a copy of the source code, enter
	</p>
	<pre class="dark">
$ git clone --recursive
	https://github.com/wjakob/nori2</pre>
	<p>
		on the terminal. 
		We'll publish extensions and bug-fixes to this
		repository as the semester progresses. To get them, 
		navigate into the <tt>nori2</tt>directory and run the command
<pre class="dark">
$ git pull</pre>
		If there were any concurrent modifications to the same file,
		<tt>git</tt> may ask you to resolve merge conflicts. We refer you to
		the learning resources for information about resolving conflicts in
		general.

			<h3>Cloning using source tree</h3>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			On Windows and Mac OS X, <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Source Tree</a>
			is a convenient visual front-end to Git. We particularly recommend this tool if you've
			never used Git before. When cloning the project, make sure
			that the setting for recursive cloning is active under <em>Advanced Options</em>.
			We'll publish extensions and bug-fixes to this
			repository as the semester progresses.
			You can simply <em>pull</em>
			the changes and merge them into your repository to benefit from the
			improvements.
