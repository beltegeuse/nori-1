	<h3>Cloning using the command line</h3>
	<p>
		The source code of Nori is available on <a
		href="https://github.com/wjakob/nori2">github</a>. For
		details on <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> in
		general, refer to github's <a
		href="http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html">Introduction to Git</a>.
		To check out a copy of the source code, enter
	</p>
	<pre class="dark">
$ git clone --recursive
	https://github.com/wjakob/nori2</pre>
	<p>
		on the terminal. 

		It is a good habit to frequently commit changes you made to the
		repository; this will allow you to jump back and forth
		between different versions, which can be quite useful for
		debugging. Note that we'll publish extensions and bug-fixes to this
		repository as the semester progresses. Run the command
<pre class="dark">
$ git pull</pre>
		to merge them into your repository and benefit from the
		improvements.

			<h3>Cloning using source tree</h3>

			On Windows and Mac OS X, <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Source Tree</a>
			is a convenient visual front-end to Git. We particularly recommend this tool if you've
			never used Git before. When cloning the project, make sure
			that the setting for recursive cloning is active under <em>Advanced Options</em>.
